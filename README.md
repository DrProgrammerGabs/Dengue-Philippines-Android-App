THE FIGHT AGAINST DENGUE IS ONGOING!
With the rising number of dengue fever cases and deaths nowadays, we need to do something to help people and save more lives. What can we do about it? 

To help people with signs and symptoms of dengue fever, we have designed an app that could guide you on what to do whenever you have the symptoms and warning signs of dengue fever. 

This app is based on the current dengue guidelines of the World Health Organization. It is based on a clinical algorithm of WHO which is specially suited for representing a sequence of clinical decisions, for teaching clinical decision making, and for guiding patient care. 

Through this app, patients will know what to do next when they have probable signs and symptoms of dengue fever. It wil advise them what to do when they experience warning signs and whether they need immediate hospital care. It can also help you find the hospital nearest you that you can call for immediate transport and care.
